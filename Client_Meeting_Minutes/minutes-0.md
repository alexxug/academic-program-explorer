Nobody chaired this initial meeting

### Agenda
- Getting to know each other
- High level discussion of our project

### Reflection
- What worked?
- What didn't work?
  - We found that having a mixture of F2F and online means the online people got left out of the conversation a lot of the time 
- How can I improve?
  - We have decided our next meeting will be completely online so everyone is equal, but we will sometimes ensure to have F2F meetings, for those who can.
- When might I use this again?

### Follow up actions
- [X] Aarti: Draft email for client, to be shared on Teams so we can all proof read
